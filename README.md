## Install from source

To install go, check out the [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install).

Run the following command to have cjdcmd-ng download, build, and install:

    go get github.com/glycerine/cjdcmd-ng


## Configuration

You'll need a to create the file ''~/.cjdnsadmin'' so that cjdcmd-ng knows how
to connect to CJDNS.

```
{
        "addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 11234,
        "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "config": "/etc/cjdroute.conf"
}
```

If you are using NixOS (like me) the password is stored in /etc/cjdns.keys.
